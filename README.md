# AlgorandUnity
 Unity example using Algorand .NET SDK
 
# How to install Unity3D

In this example we will use Unity 3D Version 2019.4.14f1 Personal

To download and install Unity, please see: [https://store.unity.com/download-nuo](https://store.unity.com/download-nuo)

We also use the Algorand SDK .NET based on this Github repo: [https://github.com/RileyGe/dotnet-algorand-sdk](https://github.com/RileyGe/dotnet-algorand-sdk) and some free Unity Assets like:

* [Hover.cs Script by jeffcrouse](https://gist.github.com/jeffcrouse/b61ace83fbcb6d366589a645ed930cc8) 
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/gridbox-prototype-materials-129127
* https://github.com/Pheffers/UnityCameraExample
* https://github.com/UnityCommunity/UnitySingleton
* https://github.com/muckSponge/UnityAsync
* https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx
* https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask
* https://github.com/PimDeWitte/UnityMainThreadDispatcher
* https://github.com/OneBitSoftware/Unity-UniRxDispatcher/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/RxDispatcher.cs
* https://github.com/nickgravelyn/UnityToolbag/blob/main/Dispatcher/Dispatcher.cs

In the example we use [Purestack](https://www.purestake.com/networks/algorand/) Algorand Public Node in TESTNET. It is more convenient for a possible final application in Unity to use a remote system such as Purestack by creating the various Algorand transactions locally via the .NET SDK.
